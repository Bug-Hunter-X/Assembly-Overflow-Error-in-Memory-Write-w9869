# Assembly Overflow Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: integer overflow.  The `bug.asm` file contains code that adds two registers and stores the result in memory without handling potential overflow. This can lead to unexpected program behavior and crashes. The `bugSolution.asm` file shows how to correctly handle this situation.
