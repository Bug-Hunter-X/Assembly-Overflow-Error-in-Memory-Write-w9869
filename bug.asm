```assembly
mov ax, bx
add ax, cx
mov dx, ax
mov [2000h], dx
```
This code snippet attempts to store the sum of registers `bx` and `cx` into memory location `2000h`. However, it fails to handle potential overflow. If the sum of `bx` and `cx` exceeds 65535 (the maximum value for a 16-bit register), an overflow will occur, leading to an incorrect value being stored in memory. This could lead to unexpected program behavior or crashes.
